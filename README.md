# Presynaptic inhibition and step initiation software

## Introduction
This repository provides the Python code used for an ongoing study at the [Oregon Health & Science University Balance Disorders Laboratory](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/neurology/balance-disorders-laboratory). The study relies heavily on the work done by Lira et al.:
>Lira JLO, Ugrinowitsch C, Coelho DB, Teixeira LA, de Lima-Pardini AC, Magalh√£es FH, Barbosa ER, Horak FB, Silva-Batista C. Loss of presynaptic inhibition for step initiation in parkinsonian individuals with freezing of gait. J Physiol. 2020 Apr;598(8):1611-1624. doi: 10.1113/JP279068. Epub 2020 Mar 12. PMID: 32020612; PMCID: PMC7372638.

The experimental set-up requires the integration of a force platform, nerve stimulator, and electromyography system. The work done by Lira et al. used LabVIEW to handle the software control of these various systems. I have recreated their software using Python.
